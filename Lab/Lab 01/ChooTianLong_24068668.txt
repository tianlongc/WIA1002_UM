My name is Choo Tian Long with matrix number, 24068668. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because taking Data Structure is a challenging and rewarding subject for me to continuously improving in my coding journey.

I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will try spending more time to explore and do more coding exercises. Wish me luck!!!

It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did consistently good in this course, as I managed to complete all the exercises given.
